# 25-prj02-kinderspiel-ptaitl

This game was created in the context of the MTIN lessons with Prof. Meerwald-Stadler, Dipl.-Ing. Susanne of the HTL Salzburg. (School year 2022/23)

## Assignment

There are three analog games to choose from. One of them is to be recreated in digital form with Unity. I chose the game _»Affenbande«_.

> **Note:** The finished game can be played [here!](https://5ahmns-wisem22-23.github.io/25-prj02-kinderspiel-ptaitl/)

## Game Logic

The game logic, which can be seen in the description below, has been entirely built in digital form.

## Style

Graphically, the game is kept very simple to appeal to the target audience (children up to 6 years). The main colors are green and brown (see screenshot below from the game).

The game was tested by three classmates who each wrote issues. No bugs were found.

Since this is a school project, all scripts are commented in great detail to make it easier to judge the work and to understand the context. So these comments are not to be judged as code smells.
