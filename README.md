# 25-prj02-kinderspiel-ptaitl

This game was created in the context of the MTIN lessons with Prof. Meerwald-Stadler, Dipl.-Ing. Susanne of the HTL Salzburg. (School year 2022/23)

> **Note:** The finished game can be played [Here!](https://5ahmns-wisem22-23.github.io/25-prj02-kinderspiel-ptaitl/)

## Assignment

There are three analog games to choose from. One of them is to be recreated in digital form with Unity.

## Game Logic

The following game logic results from the additional features:

A car has 60 seconds to pick up as many gifts as possible and bring them to the gift bag. When the time is up, the game is over and it is checked if a new high score has been achieved. Also, the player (the car) has some health. Whenever it passes over a kill zone, it loses health. If all lives are used up, the game is over and it is checked whether a new highscore has been achieved.

## Final note

Since this is a school project, all scripts are commented in great detail to make it easier to judge the work and to understand the context. So these comments are not to be judged as code smells.
